My shopping list:

 * A delicious & huge cucumber

 * Estrogen

 * Strong lube

 * A candle

### Consider the following code:

```cpp
auto winSize = CCDirector::sharedDirector()->getWinSize();

auto label = CCLabelBMFont::create("Hello world!", "bigFont.fnt");
label->setPosition(winSize / 2);
this->addChild(label);
```

We don't know what it does. ![Alt text](GJ_button_01.png)

```cpp
mmmm.... cucumber
```
What!??!? what does `that` mean?
